/* Styling CSS */
/* * Only the `p` elements that are descendants of the `div` element should have a yellow background,
 red text, a font size of 20px, and center aligned.*/

 div .text {
    background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0);
    color:red;
    font-size:20px;
    text-align:center;
 }
 
 /* Mistakes to avoid , make sure that for type selector / element selector, it didn't have
 fullstop in front, only the name of element, like div like text. only class selector have . 
 
 Selector - syntax
 type / group - just element name
 class - . (class name)
 id - # (id name)
 multiple class - . (class name) 
 group - . class name, .class name
 chain - .class name.class name
 descendant combinator - mix between class and type*/
